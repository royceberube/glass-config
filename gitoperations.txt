You’ll just use the normal Git workflow to pick up your local changes and push them back up to GitHub. In your project folder, open a terminal (or Git Bash) and run:

Check what’s changed

git status
This will show you which files are new or modified.

Stage your changes
To stage everything:

git add .
Or stage individual files:

git add src/parser.js src/parser.test.js

Commit
Give your commit a brief message describing what you did:

git commit -m "Convert parser.js to CommonJS and add tests"
Push
Assuming you cloned or set up your remote as origin and your default branch is main (replace with master if that’s what yours is), run:

git push origin main
If you haven’t yet added a remote, you’ll need to do that once:

git remote add origin git@github.com:royceberube/glass-config.git
git push -u origin main
A couple of gotchas
Authentication:
If GitHub prompts for a password, you’ll now need to supply a Personal Access Token (PAT) instead of your account password. You can generate one in your GitHub Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens (give it at least the “repo” scope), and use that as your password.

Private repo:
Since your repo is already set to “Private” on GitHub, no one else will see it unless you explicitly add them as a collaborator.

Let me know if you hit any errors (authentication failures, remote‑not‑found, etc.) and I can help you sort them out!
